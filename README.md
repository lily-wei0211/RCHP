## Running 

**Installation and data preparation please follow [attMPTI](https://github.com/Na-Z/attMPTI).**



### Training

Pretrain the segmentor which includes feature extractor module on the available training set:

```bash
bash scripts/pretrain_segmentor.sh
```

Train our method under few-shot setting:

```bash
bash scripts/train_RCHP.sh
```

### Evaluation

Test our method under few-shot setting:

```bash
bash scripts/eval_RCHP.sh
```

Note that the above scripts are used for 2-way 1-shot on S3DIS (S^0). Please modify the corresponding hyperparameters to conduct experiments on other settings. 


## Quick Use

### Step 1: Add Testing Episode Files

Place the testing episode files for [S3DIS](#) into the `datasets` directory.

üìÅ Shared File: **S3DIS.zip**

üîë Extraction Code: `6aez`

### Step 2: Add Our Checkpoints

Place the provided checkpoint and log files for [RCHP](#) into the [`log_s3dis`](https://github.com/lily-wei0211/RCHP/tree/main/log_s3dis) directory.

üìÅ Shared File: **RCHP.zip**
